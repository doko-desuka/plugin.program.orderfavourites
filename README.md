### This is a simple & lightweight program add-on that lets you quickly reorganize your Kodi favourites.  

# How to install:

There are two ways:

A) [From the zips in the Releases page](https://github.com/doko-desuka/plugin.program.orderfavourites/releases).

B) To install from a URL, do this:  
> Go to Settings > File Manager > Add source, use the link https://doko-desuka.github.io/ and give it a name.  
> After that, go to Add-ons > \*Add-ons browser (the open box icon on the top-left, Estuary skin) > Install from zip file > select that named source > see the zips for this add-on for either Leia or Matrix+. Select a zip to install it.  
>  
> \* You can also access the Add-ons browser by going to Settings > Add-ons.

# Main menus & how to use:

### 1) Order favourites...   
Opens a dialog where you can view and reorder your Favourites items.   
- To reorder items, select an item to "mark" it, then select another item to **swap their place**.  
(If an item is marked, you can select it again to unmark it.)  
- Press the Close button to close that dialog when you're done editing. Your changes won't be saved yet.
- If you've made some mistakes and want to start over, press the "Restore..." button to restore the favourites order from the Kodi favourites file, or also close the dialog and re-open it. This will undo your unsaved changes.
   
### 2) Save and reload
Saves your changes and reloads your Kodi profile, so your changes can be seen immediately instead of you having to restart Kodi to see them.
   
### 3) Save and exit
Saves your changes but doesn't reload Kodi (as this operation can crash in some Kodi builds). After using this, you have to manually restart Kodi to see your changes.

### 4) Exit only
Just steps back from the add-on, no saving.

PS: I consider this add-on feature frozen, I just wanted a quicker way to move Favorite items around. Feel free to fork and modify it, the code is public domain.

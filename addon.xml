[COLOR lavender][B]Order Favourites[/B][/COLOR]
[B]1.3.0:[/B]
- Changed the movement method to "Swap item A and B". The old method used to be
"Remove A and re-insert it around B", confusing and disruptive.

[B]1.2.3:[/B]
- Add-on metadata update with an icon fix.

[B]1.2.2:[/B]
- Ported the improvements from the Leia version to the Matrix version.

[B]1.2.1:[/B]
- Renamed "Save and exit" to "Save and reload", makes it clearer.
- Added "Save and exit". Use this when save + reload happens to crash your Kodi. After saving, restart Kodi manually to see the changes.
- Experimental Matrix version now available.

[B]1.2.0:[/B]
- Fixed a case when the add-on failed to read the favourites file because of Unicode strings.
(Thanks to [I]msauers[/I] for the report.)
- Changed the label and description of the 'Restart...' button to 'Restore...', which is
clearer.

[B]1.1.1:[/B]
- Added menu items for a more traditional add-on UX.
- Improved the profile reloading process.

[B]1.1.0:[/B]
- Improved the profile reloading process, it was crashing on Kodi 17.6.

[B]1.0.4:[/B]
- Safer handling of unicode text.
- Optimizations, simplified the code even more.

[B]1.0.3:[/B]
- Added a proper custom dialog interface.
- Greatly simplified the code, much faster to use.

[B]1.0.2:[/B]
- Fix for when the favorite item has unicode text.
